# Hello, Human Person!

I have learned that each of us was born as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and the rest of our lives ought to be a repeated reiteration cycle of improvements, "bug fixes" and building of new features. Aka GROWTH. I am learning to embody the hard work and discipline it requires to eliminate the skill gaps logged during "previous sprints".
